                    <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
